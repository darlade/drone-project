Plan:

Work on Fusion360 prototype (3-6 months)
Build 1/10th scale prototype (6-9 months)
Increase scale linearly until at full scale (a long time)

Reasoning:

Current defense incumbents are lacking in agility and willingness to change their processes
This creates an opportunity for new founders to create products which undercut the market
That could be in either price, features, or production rate

I will be aiming to produce a highly attritable aircraft, this will be done by selecting off the shelf parts as well as unlicenced polymers. I could instead try to pack as many valuable features in as I can, but focusing on that area would increase cost and decrease production rate due to increased complexity.

Focusing solely on production rate might leave the craft too simple.
