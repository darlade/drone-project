Plan:

- Work on Fusion360 prototype (3-6 months)
- Build 1/10th scale prototype (6-9 months)
- Increase scale linearly until at full scale (a long time)

Reasoning:

- Current defense incumbents are lacking in agility and willingness to change their processes
- This creates an opportunity for new founders to create products which undercut the market
- That could be in either price, features, or production rate

I will be aiming to produce a highly attritable aircraft, this will be done by selecting off the shelf parts as well as unlicenced polymers. I could instead try to pack as many valuable features in as I can, but focusing on that area would increase cost and decrease production rate due to increased complexity.

Focusing solely on production rate might leave the craft too simple.
